I introduced earthy wood textures and green elements to strengthen the environmental connotations of using TRITHOR over their poison based competitors.</p>",

Affluent homeowners are the secondary user group, directed to the site by builders/developers as the primary group who use the site as a sales and information tool. Keeping termite damage imagery to a minimum, we instead focused on the 'set and forget' USP aspect of installing TRITHOR.</p><p>Adding to this luxury feel, I designed large, crosslinked message boxes and set technical information in smaller segments to alleviate the imposition on homeowners to read heavy technical information aimed at builders.</p><p>The website is built on wordpress and implements encrypted form transactions to pass sensitive data including credit card details and warranty claims.</p>",
